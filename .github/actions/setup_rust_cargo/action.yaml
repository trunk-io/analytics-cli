      # Note: When running on Windows runners, rustup will install the MSVC host toolchain
      # (e.g., nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) by default. This is expected and harmless.
      # The MSVC toolchain is only used to compile test code on Windows runners.
      # The actual Windows binaries are built on Linux using the GNU toolchain (x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)
      # via cross-compilation, not on Windows runners.
